Implement the work described by the user in the spec or tickets.

Use /tdd where possible, at pre-agreed seams.

Run typechecking regularly, single test files regularly, and the full test suite once at the end.

Once done, use /code-review to review the work.

Commit your work to the current branch.

If you open a PR, always open it as a draft (`gh pr create --draft`) and write the title and body with /gh-desc.
